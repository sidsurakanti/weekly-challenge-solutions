# Solutions
My solutions for the weekly challenges held in the [@techwithtim](https://github.com/techwithtim)'s [discord server](https://discord.gg/twt). You'll notice the solutions might not always be the most readable. That's because the competition favored short and/or fast solutions over readability.
